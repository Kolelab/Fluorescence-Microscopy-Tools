# Fluorescence-Microscopy-Tools
A collection of scripts and building instructions for fluorescence microscopy applications.
This portfolio is a collection of scripts for fluorescence microscopy applications. 
These different projects were initiated to provide a solution for combining live 
overlay of transmitted light and epifluorescence images for electrophysiology experiments, but 
can also be adopted to e.g. cell culture applications. Other projects include: 
1. Popsar - code for imaging of e.g. fluorescent calcium indicators (OGB-1, Fluo-4, GCaMPs) 
1. Slider - digital control of LED intensities.



Project | Description
------------ | -------------
TEAMSTER | Code for Micromanager and Arduino to perform switching of light sources and overlay two imaging channels in Micromanager. Building instructions and circuit diagrams are provided.
Popsar | PropellerIDE code for high-speed dual imaging or simultaneous photo-activation and imaging (dual-channel). Circuit diagram and building instructions for Popsar are also provided
SLIDER | Arduino code for digital control of LED intensities, building instructions, circuit diagrams and stl files for a 3D printable enclosure.


Some of the underlying principal concepts about hardware triggering are discussed here:
