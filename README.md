# Fluorescence-Microscopy-Tools
A collection of tools for fluorescence microscopy applications that include code and building instructions.
This portfolio is a collection of scripts for fluorescence microscopy applications. 
These different projects were initiated to provide a solution for:
1. Combining live overlay of transmitted light and epifluorescence images for electrophysiology experiments. It can be easily  adopted to e.g. cell culture applications.  
1. Fast imaging of e.g. fluorescent calcium indicators (Fura-2, OGB-1, Fluo-4, GCaMPs) or any other fluorescent indicator 
1. Digital precise control of LED intensities.



Project | Description
------------ | -------------
TEAMSTER | Code for Micromanager and Arduino to perform switching of light sources and overlay two imaging channels in Micromanager. Building instructions and circuit diagrams are provided.
Popsar | PropellerIDE code for high-speed dual imaging or simultaneous photo-activation and imaging (dual-channel). Circuit diagram and building instructions for Popsar are also provided
SLIDER | Arduino code for digital control of LED intensities, building instructions, circuit diagrams and stl files for a 3D printable enclosure.


Some of the underlying principal concepts about hardware triggering are discussed and explained here:
